# **File Compression using Huffman Coding**

This project implements a **lossless file compression algorithm** using **Huffman Coding** in C. Huffman Coding is a widely used algorithm for data compression that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

---

## **Features**
- **Compression:** Compresses a text file into a binary file using Huffman Coding.
- **Decompression:** Decompresses the binary file back into the original text file.
- **Efficient Storage:** Reduces file size by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters.
- **Lossless Compression:** Ensures the original data is perfectly reconstructed after decompression.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Frequency Calculation:** The program reads the input file and calculates the frequency of each character.
2. **Huffman Tree Construction:** A Huffman tree is built using a **min-heap** (priority queue) based on character frequencies.
3. **Code Generation:** Huffman codes are generated by traversing the Huffman tree.
4. **File Compression:** The input file is compressed by replacing each character with its corresponding Huffman code.
5. **File Decompression:** The compressed file is decompressed using the Huffman tree to reconstruct the original file.

## **Data Structures Used**
- **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):** To build the Huffman tree.
- **Binary Tree:** To represent the Huffman tree structure.
- **Hash Table (Array):** To store character frequencies and Huffman codes.
- **Bitwise Operations:** To handle binary data during compression and decompression.

## **Files in the Project**
1. **`huffman.c`:** The main C program implementing Huffman Coding.
2. **`input.txt`:** The input text file to be compressed.
3. **`compressed.bin`:** The compressed binary file generated after compression.
4. **`decompressed.txt`:** The decompressed text file generated after decompression.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
- A text file (`input.txt`) to compress.

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository or download the `huffman.c` file.
2. Place your input text file (`input.txt`) in the same directory as the program.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc huffman.c -o huffman
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./huffman
   ```
5. Check the output files:
   - **`compressed.bin`:** The compressed binary file.
   - **`decompressed.txt`:** The decompressed text file (should match `input.txt`).

---

## **Example**

### **Input File (`input.txt`)**
```
Hello, World!
```

### **Output Files**
1. **`compressed.bin`:** Binary file containing the compressed data.
2. **`decompressed.txt`:** Text file containing the decompressed data (same as `input.txt`).

---

## **Limitations**
- The program currently works only for **text files**.
- It does not handle very large files efficiently due to memory constraints.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Add support for compressing **binary files**.
- Optimize memory usage for handling larger files.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
